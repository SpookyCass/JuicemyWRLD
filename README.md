# JuicemyWRLD

## About
In the screenshots above, you see the index with instructions to the user about what this website is and how to begin the experience, as well as what
happens when you choose one of the options. It first takes you to a quote, which leads to two other options that lead to different quotes.
Once on the quote page, there are two "buttons" on the right, which actually are not buttons, but give you more information when you hover over them.
This was a feature I was really excited to add to my website, because It was something new I learned, which I mention below. This "meaning" tab tells the user
how I interpret and relate to each specific lyric on each page, but I kept it hidden until hover so that they would read it and interpret it themselves first.
This is because the goal of my website was so either educate the user on Juice WRLD, myself, or even learn something about themselves, based on how they relate
to the lyrics, or relate to how I view it. I added a total of 5 quotes, 6 pages on the website in total, but I plan to add more, I just didn't have time before
the due date, because I had to take the time to write about each one individually, as well as link them in a non-liner, interesting way. I linked the next quote
based on a word in the previous quote, if I thought it made me think of it. If that makes sense.
On the index, not viewable here, the left-hand nav bar is basically just jump-to links that lead to sections further on the index page itself, and give more
information related to what the title of each tab is. I talk about the basic background of Juice, why he is important to me and many others, as well as links
to the songs I used in the website, my spotify playlist, and his subreddit, which is a huge community showcasing how Juice's legend will live on, through art,
music, and much more. I cannot wait to share my work once I figure out how to make it live. I have spent a lot of time on it and am really proud and happy with it.

## Inspiration

I was obviously inspired by the rapper and artist by the name of Juice WLRD, but above are some images of his album covers and tattoos, where I got
inspiration for my fonts and theme for my website. As you will hopefully read on my website, after it is made live, Juice is a huge inspiration to me and
many others, which is why I chose this topic for this project, based on his song lyrics.

## Challenges
A challenge I tried to solve was getting text to appear only when you hover over a different text, which I figured out using online tutorials and the CSS after
pseudo-element feature. I also had to improve my understanding of making flex boxes work the way I want, for I have used them in the past, but they always give
me trouble.
