           <p class="plaintext">
             I made this website because I really love Juice WRLD, his music, and the way he expresses himself creatively. I am so inspired by his work, and wanted to share what I love about his songs and lyrics specifically here with others, and allow them to get an inside look into his art, with this interactive experience. Hopefully this has, or will give you something you can relate to, and if not, I hope you at least learned something about Juice WRLD, me, or yourself.

          <h1 id="LLJW">Long Live Juice WRLD</h1>
           <p class="plaintext">
             Jarad Anthony Higgins, professionally known as Juice WRLD, was born and raised in Chicago on December 2nd 1998, and started making a name for himself in rap in highschool. He released his first album "Goodbye & Good Riddance," in 2018, with Grade A Productions, who he was signed to. This album is home to one of his most popular songs titled "Lucid Dreams," which actually was certified Diamond, which means it has over 10 million streams/sales. He also said that he wrote that song in less than 30 minutes, and didn't think it would get as popular as it did.
           </p>
           <p class="plaintext">
             He then released his sophomore album, "Death Race For Love," in 2019, which he wrote in less than a week, and is about 72 minutes long, which is quite long for a rap album. This was the last album he released before his death on December 8th, 2019, due to an accidental drug overdose.

           </p>
           <p class="plaintext">
             In his lyrics, he always expresses his emotions in such a raw, relatable way, which is why he has so many followers, including me. His mother has stated that he has gone to therapy a lot as a child and teen, which is why this flows so naturally to him. The way he executes this and makes beautiful music is so inspirational and helps others who feel similar to express themselves, as well as find new ways to be creative and make more beautiful art based on him and what he stood for, inlcluding this website!
           </p>
           <p class="plaintext">
             This is why we say LLJW "Long Live Juice WRLD" and "Legends Never Die," which is actually the name of his third album which was released after his death. This is to show how his fans will carry on his legacy forever and share his work, and continue to be inspired by it to create more and more. I am personally so Inspired by him and am literally crying while I am writing this right now. I also should probably mention that he does have a fourth released album called "Fighting Demons," but I waited to add this because, as I said, since his last two albums were released after his death, I don't feel like they are an authentic representation of how he would've wanted them to be, with the songs, order, or album art. This is because, obviously his label and team of people just determine what is released of his and when, which is kind of controversial in the community because everyone thinks his label doesn't care about him and is just "milking" him for more money. Which is probably true in some respects, but also how else would we get access to all of his unreleased songs at some point?

             <h2>9 9 9</h2>
             <p class="plaintext">
               999 to Juice, means taking all of the negative things that come your way in life, and turning them into something positive. It is a well known symbol for his brand, and comes from the triple didgit number 666 flipped upside down to represent this. 
               </p>
          <h2>Freestyling</h2>
          <p class="plaintext">
             As I previously mentioned, Juice has said to have written most of his songs pretty quickly, because he didn't actually write as much as he fresstyled to the beats, and then made a song from that, or even released some songs that were full freestyles. He has been labeled as one of the best freestyle rappers in rap, and there are many youtube videos showcasing this, including one where he raps <a href = "https://youtu.be/igc1wYW448w" target="_blank">for an hour straight,</a> which is very impressive, as most rappers cannot go that long. 
          </p>
          <p class="plaintext">
            This is how he made so many songs so quickly, but still managed to make them so good, because this was just his talent, to be able to come up with raw, emotionally, witty rhymes and lines on the spot, is something a lot of people cannot do well. He has said that he has over 2,000 songs recorded, and there are only so many that are actually released in his albums. This is why there is a whole community of people sharing his unreleased songs, and why there will still be a lot of content of his to look forward to, even though he has already passed. 
            </p>
            <p class = "plaintext">
              Before I found my love for Juice, I would occasionally fresstyle with my boyfriend and his old friends, but I never really got into until I listen to Juice and wanted to try and improve my freestyle rapping. I have gotten all of my friends to freestyle with me to beats on youtube, and although we are not perfect, It is a lot of fun, and it is so satisfying to see improvement and play with it. Sometimes we try and rap over instrumental songs we like of varying styles, and we even try and bounce off of eachother.

         <h1 id="song-list">Included Songs</h1>

           Although I plan to add more songs and quotes to this experience, as of right now, below is the list of included songs on this website.
        </p>
             <ul id="plaintextFlex">

          <h2 id="playlist">My Playlist</h2>
             <p class="plaintext">
               I have a playlist on Spotify titled <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0NBiNnWZjpoCsiPGtWIdie?si=519810b9726f4992" target="_blank">"Mostly Juice,"</a> if you are interested in listening to more of his music, I would reccomend it. It also features similar songs from other rappers and artists, as well as a few that I just enjoy, but as the title suggests, it is mostly Juice's music, including unreleased songs on spotify. These are frequently taken down though, so watch out.

          <h2>Juice WRLD Subreddit</h2>
             <p class="plaintext">
               Reddit is a website where people can join communities and talk annonymously about anything they want with people who are interested in discussing the same things. It is a website/app that I really enjoy, and always go to when I want an inside look on a topic or community. When I got into Juice WRLD, I obviously went to Reddit and found this community of Juice's fans, where they discuss news, songs, art, and just about anything Juice WRLD, obviously. 
             </p>
             <p class="plaintext">
               If you are at all interested in Juice and his legacy after going through and reading about my website, I would highly reccomend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JuiceWRLD/" target="_blank"> checking it out.</a> It is also a place where artists and creatives share their works inspired by Juice, and I think it is a great representation of what he was all about, and the most important part of his legacy to me, which is the inspiration of his art to make more and spread what he stood for. 
             </p>
